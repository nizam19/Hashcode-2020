# Hashcode-2020
Our team's take on the Google HashCode 2020 Qualification round

Know more about [Hashcode](g.co/hashcode)

My team @[pythxnbyte](https://github.com/PythxnBite) @[sriharsha2000](https://github.com/sriharsha2000) @[mangipudiprashanth7](https://github.com/mangipudiprashanth7)

Our [problem statement](https://github.com/nizam19/Hashcode-2020/blob/master/problem_statement/hashcode_2020_online_qualification_round.pdf)

We solved the problem in C++ here's our [solution](https://github.com/nizam19/Hashcode-2020/blob/master/solutions/cpp/main.cpp)

Here are the [input files](https://github.com/nizam19/Hashcode-2020/tree/master/input) and our final submission's [output files](https://github.com/nizam19/Hashcode-2020/tree/master/output)

## Coding

Reading the problem statement and solving for sample A dataset fetched us 20 points

In case you're intrested here's our further score progression

Just implementing the basic problem, this was done to see weather we were reading the data as required and generating the output files accordingly, suprisingly it fetched us a pretty decent score.

For this submission did basically the same thing but were traversing the input backwards fetched us about 200k points more

Tried to think of a logic and basically sorted the input and almost doubled our score this was the most jolly momet of the contest

Instead of basic sorting we considered some more attributes of data for our final solution this also gave us about some score rise

#### Finally we ended up

Global rank **3753 out of 10724**

Country rank (India) **626 out of 3116**

In my opinion the competition went very well for a team which had a perfect 0 score at Hashcode 2019

This was very fun, learned a lot about real world software engineering and problem statements and the importance of object oriented design and design principles :joy:
